# **Data Structures**

Useful data structures for competitive programming.

## **Static/Dynamic Arrays**

| Name | `get` | `add` | `remove` | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Arrays | O(1) | O(n)* | O(n)* | Can't resize |
| Vectors | O(1) | O(n)* | O(n)* | |
| Linked Lists | O(n) | O(1) | O(1) | High memory cost |

*O(1) for adding/removing at the end

## **Stacks, (Priority) Queues, and Deques**

| Name | `push` | `pop` | `peek` | `get` | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Stacks | O(1) | O(1) | O(1) | O(n) | LIFO (last in first out) |
| Queues | O(1) | O(1) | O(1) | O(n) | FIFO (first in first out)|
| Deques | O(1) | O(1) | O(1) | O(n) | both LIFO/FIFO, can insert and delete at both ends |
| Priority Queue | O(log n) | O(log n) | O(1) | O(n) | automatically sorts in decreasing order |

## **Sets**
